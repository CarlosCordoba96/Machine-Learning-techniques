# MILESTONE 7 

The objective of this milestone is only to improve our model. In this documentation, we are gooing to explain our model in a submission-based way. This means that we are going to explain the changes in our code made for each submission. We are going to describe our score as well, and the improvement/decrease in the competition ranking.
