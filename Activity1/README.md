# Conclusion after finishing Milestone 1:

We have divided into 3 files each of the tasks:

01_pivot.py - We take the initial data, and only save the ones that we need for our computations; this is the Iquitos data from 2000-2003. We removed the columns labeled 'year', 'city', 'date'; and converted not valid values into NaN for future computations.

02_correlation.py - We compute the correlation coefficient and plot 2 different graphs for checking the simetry on our data.

03_pc.py - We compute the PCA to help us view the internal structure of the data.

## Final thoughts

In conclusion after seeing the different graphs we can say that our data is not very symetric; as there are some zones were the data is correlated but; on the other hand there are other zones where is very visible that the data is not correlated.
