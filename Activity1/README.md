# Conclusion after finishing Milestone 1:

We have divided into 3 files each of the tasks:

1. [01_pivot.py](https://github.com/CarlosCordoba96/Machine-Learning-techniques/blob/master/Activity1/01_pivot.py)
We take the initial data, and only save the ones that we need for our computations; this is the Iquitos data from 2000-2003. We removed the columns labeled 'year', 'city', 'date'; and converted not valid values into NaN for future computations.

2. [02_correlation.py](https://github.com/CarlosCordoba96/Machine-Learning-techniques/blob/master/Activity1/02_correlation.py)
 We compute the correlation coefficient and plot 2 different graphs for checking the simetry on our data.

3. [03_pca.py](https://github.com/CarlosCordoba96/Machine-Learning-techniques/blob/master/Activity1/03_pca.py) - We compute the PCA to help us view the internal structure of the data.

## Final thoughts

In conclusion after seeing the different graphs we can say that our data is not very symetric; as there are some zones were the data is correlated but; on the other hand there are other zones where is very visible that the data is not correlated.
