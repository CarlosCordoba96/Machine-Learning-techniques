Data Set (city and years)
Number of elements of your data set
the chosen number of clusters (k) and a brief explanation about why you have chosen this value of k.

Also, you have to attach the graphical result of your clustering (only one chart - PCA results- with elements represented by in different colours).

The script(s) must be uploaded on the github/bitbucket repository related to the Class Work.

Recommendations: 
remove outliers before the clustering, test with different options of initialization (random, k-means++),
(optional) select only a subset of features, or use only the PCA results
