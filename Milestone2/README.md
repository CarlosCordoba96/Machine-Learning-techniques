# Milestone 2

1. Study of the different distances and election of one for the characterization.
 
We have tried different distances on out file, and after a few tries decided to chose the Euclidean distance and combine it with a 'Complete' cluster hierarchy for the Denogram process. Our criterion was distance. This can be seen in the file [cluster_hierarchical.py](https://github.com/CarlosCordoba96/Machine-Learning-techniques/blob/master/Milestone2/cluster_hierarchical.py)

We studied the results in hierarchical clustering and PCA. In the second one, we could see the dimensional representation of all the elements divided in the clusters. We could see some elements that could act as outliers in PCA but appeared in a grouped cluster in the hierarchical representation, while some elements in PCA that seems to be grouped in a cluster are represented as outliers in clustering.
