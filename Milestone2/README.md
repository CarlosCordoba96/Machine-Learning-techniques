# Milestone 2

1. Study of the different distances and election of one for the characterization.
 
We have tried different distances on out file, and after a few tries decided to chose the Euclidean distance and combine it with a 'Complete' cluster hierarchy for the Denogram process. This can be seen in the file [cluster_hierarchical.py](https://github.com/CarlosCordoba96/Machine-Learning-techniques/blob/master/Milestone2/cluster_hierarchical.py)
