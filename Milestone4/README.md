# Milestone 4 - Decission Tree for regression

## 1.- Studying the correlation between features and total cases

After this step, we have obtained this ![correlation graph](https://github.com/CarlosCordoba96/Machine-Learning-techniques/blob/master/Milestone4/img/correlation.png).

We have studied the correlation of our dataset variables related to dengue cases. From this information, we have concluded that variables such as:

* reanalysis_avg_temp_k
* reanalysis_min_air_temp_k
* reanalysis_relative_humidity_percent
* reanalysis_specific_humidity_g_per_kg
* station_mean_temp_c

heavily influentiate the dengue cases. This leads us to think that the temperature and the humidity of a certain zone matters to dengue cases.
