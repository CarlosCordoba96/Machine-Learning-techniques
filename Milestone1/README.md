# Milestone 1:

We have divided into 3 files each of the tasks:

* [01_pivot.py](https://github.com/CarlosCordoba96/Machine-Learning-techniques/blob/master/Activity1/01_pivot.py)
In this script the initial data is readen and filtered to, later, save only the data needed for our computations; this is the Iquitos data from 2000-2003. 
The columns labeled 'year', 'city', 'date' have been removed as they are not necessary for future purposes. 
Not valid values have been turned into NaN to ease future tasks.

* [02_correlation.py](https://github.com/CarlosCordoba96/Machine-Learning-techniques/blob/master/Activity1/02_correlation.py)
 In this script, the correlation coefficient is computed, and 2 different graphs are plotted for feature selection. This is useful for checking the simetry of our data.

* [03_pca.py](https://github.com/CarlosCordoba96/Machine-Learning-techniques/blob/master/Activity1/03_pca.py) 
In this script, the PCA is computed in order to help us view the internal structure of our data.

## Overview

After seeing the different graphs we can say that our data is not very symetric; as there are some zones were the data is correlated but, on the other hand there are other zones where is very visible that the data is more diverse.
